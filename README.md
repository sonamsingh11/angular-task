## Instructions:

Fork this repo and complete the following task. *Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this project.* Please submit a pull request with your work once finished.

### Task
Use ngrx and create or modify appropriate actions, reducers, and selectors.

The user profile page is currently loaded with dummy data. Use the public API at [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)
to create a service to pull in a random user and populate the profile page. You should get the relevant data from the API to fill a `ProfileStore`.

Create a new page, a profile list. Pull in 10 random profiles to populate this list, and make each profile list item
clickable, sending the user to a user details page with that user data. The UI is up to you, although it is reccomended to use Angular Material components
